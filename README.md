# Rust Push Id
A Rust library for creating Firebase-style push id:s

## NB
This is my first attempt at rust. Hence, the code is not likely to be idiomatic Rust. I'll gladly accept improvements and PR:s.

## Credits
I was inspired by [this Gist from mikelehen](https://gist.github.com/mikelehen/3596a30bd69384624c11)
Mine is faster, his is prettier. :)
